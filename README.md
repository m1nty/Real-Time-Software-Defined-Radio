## Real-time SDR for mono/stereo FM and RDS

The main objective of the project is to navigate a complex speciÔ¨Åcation and understand the challenges that must be addressed for a real-time implementation of a computing system that operates in a form factor-constrained environment. 

The project specification except the RDS part is in the [partial project document](doc/3dy4-project-partial.pdf). The RDS part will be released on or before March 8.
